## üìã How It Works

### Input Text Analysis
The application uses advanced LLM prompting to analyze your input text through multiple stages:
1. **Content Extraction**: Identifies key themes, topics, and supporting information
2. **Structure Generation**: Creates a logical slide outline based on content flow
3. **Slide Mapping**: Intelligently distributes content across an appropriate number of slides
4. **Content Optimization**: Formats text for slide presentation (bullet points, headings, etc.)

### Template Style Application
Your uploaded PowerPoint template is processed to extract:
- **Color Palettes**: Primary and accent colors from the template theme
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, and text styling
- **Layout Structures**: Slide layouts (title slides, content slides, section headers)
- **Visual Assets**: Images, logos, and graphics that can be reused
- **Master Slide Elements**: Headers, footers, and branding elements

The AI-generated content is then mapped to these extracted styles, ensuring your presentation maintains a professional, consistent appearance.

## üõ† Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- API key from one of the supported LLM providers:
  - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  - [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
  - [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/textoslides.git
   cd textoslides
   ```

2. **Open the application**:
   - For local development: Open `index.html` in your browser
   - For hosting: Deploy the files to any static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

3. **No build process required** - this is a vanilla JavaScript application that runs entirely in the browser.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Enter Your Content**
   - Paste your bulk text, markdown, or prose into the text area
   - The application handles content of any length (recommended: 500-5000 words for optimal slide count)

2. **Add Optional Guidance**
   - Provide specific instructions like "Turn into an investor pitch deck" or "Format as a training workshop"
   - This helps the AI structure content appropriately for your use case

3. **Configure AI Provider**
   - Select your preferred LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini)
   - Enter your API key (this is never stored or logged)
   - Choose the specific model to use

4. **Upload Your Template**
   - Drag and drop or select a PowerPoint file (.pptx or .potx)
   - The app will analyze and preview the template's styling
   - Supported file size: up to 50MB

5. **Generate Your Presentation**
   - Click "Generate Presentation" to start the AI processing
   - Watch the progress indicators as your presentation is created
   - Download the completed .pptx file when processing is complete
